# At the request of Nexus, this project is no longer available and will no longer be maintained.
### Do not attempt to harass Nexus or any of their staff!
This takedown request is well within their rights and I will respect that request, despite my disappointment.

## What happens next
Well, I can't stop you from using the app, but if Nexus pushing updates to the API absolutely can disable the app, when it inevitably breaks, you will not recieve support or advice on fixing it.
If you want to guarentee a minimum level of functionality, please use the official [Pop App](https://www.nexus.org.uk/ticket-information/pop/pop-app) or [Nexus Website](https://www.nexus.org.uk/metro).

## Can I maintain my own version?
No, if you have the source code and maintain it yourself, you will potentially face "formal action" from Nexus.
