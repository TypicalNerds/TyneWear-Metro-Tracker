# Tyne & Wear Metro Tracker
## NOTE: This app is not affiliated with Nexus or the Pop App, accuracy of information is not guarenteed.

This is just a simple tracker application for tracking times for the metro and checking the service status.<br>

## Why I built it
I got frustrated with a update to the pop app which made it difficult to track trains at specific stations and caused it to constantly crash.

## It's not working?
Check your internet connection and reload the app, all platform information is loaded from the Metro-RTI api upon app launch, so a poor connection may cause the dropdowns to not work.
Alternatively, it could just be that Nexus updated the API and the app may just need updated by me to keep functioning (if it's still possible).
